# ROOT DIRECTORY CLEANUP DECISION LOG

## Date: July 15, 2025

## FILES REMOVED FROM ROOT DIRECTORY

### Log Files (Moved to Backup)
- `auth.log` (97 bytes) - Development log from authentication service
- `gateway-manual.log` (2.8KB) - Manual gateway startup log with port mappings

**Decision:** These are temporary development logs. The same information is available in the proper logs/ directory and in the microservice documentation.

### Database Dumps (Moved to Backup)
- `leafy.dump` (247KB) - PostgreSQL database cluster dump
- `leafydump.sql` (177KB) - SQL dump file
- `leafydump_cleaned.sql` (173KB) - Cleaned SQL dump
- `leafy.sql` (247KB) - Another SQL dump file

**Decision:** These are backup files from database migration work. Since the database is now operational on Neon DB and we have proper backup systems in place, these files are no longer needed in the root directory.

### Total Space Freed: ~1MB

## FILES KEPT

### Essential Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `drizzle.config.js` - Database ORM configuration
- `.eslintrc.js` - Code linting configuration

**Decision:** These are core project files required for proper functioning.

### Questionable Files Analysis

#### next.config.performance.js
- **Analysis:** No references found in frontend applications
- **Decision:** KEEP - This is a shared performance configuration that might be used by Next.js apps
- **Reason:** Performance optimizations are valuable, even if not currently imported

#### jest.config.js & jest.setup.js
- **Analysis:** No test files found, but package.json has test script placeholder
- **Decision:** KEEP - Testing infrastructure ready for future use
- **Reason:** These files set up proper testing environment for the project

## BACKUP LOCATION

All removed files are safely stored in:
`backups/root-directory-cleanup/`

## BENEFITS ACHIEVED

1. **Cleaner Root Directory:** Removed temporary and redundant files
2. **Better Organization:** Essential files are now more visible
3. **Space Optimization:** ~1MB of space freed up
4. **Maintainability:** Easier to navigate the project structure
5. **Safety:** All removed files are backed up for future reference

## FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Add .gitignore rules to prevent log files and dumps in root
2. Use proper logs/ directory for all logging
3. Store database backups in dedicated backup system
4. Consider adding scripts to automatically clean temporary files
